# Handy.AI

A programmable Python IDE with added LLM.

The goal is a complete IDE for Python that is locally LLM powered. Users will be able to generate code, test cases, documentation and so on for any Python object.

Currently, Handy is in early development.


## Techstack

Handy is written in Python, using the PyQT libray and the Ollama API to access LLM models.
LanceDB is used as the RAG backend.
